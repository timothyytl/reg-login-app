# My Registration-Login App Project

This is my User Registration Form and Login project fully built with PERN stack (PostgresQL, Express.js, React, Node.js). This project utilises a serverless Postgres database called Neon and the database stores the basic information of users upon registration such as their name, email, and password (which is encrypted in the database) and allows users access to the main dashboard page with their given email and password. Once access to the dashboard is granted, users are able to view the dashboard page and logout whenever they are ready. This project showcases a basic full stack application with user authentication commonly used in most web and mobile applications today.
